                Complementary colors:<br>
                Complementary colors are two colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. These create a maximum contrast and maximum stability.
                </p>
                <p>
                Analogous colors:<br>
                Analogous colors are three colors that are beside each other on the color wheel. These create a rich and monochramatic look.
                </p>
                <p>
                Triadic colors:<br>
                Triadic colors are three colors evenly spaced on the color wheel. Because of the wide contrast, triadic colors are often quite dramatic, but by choosing subdued shades you can tone down the drama. To make it less overwhelming, you could also choose one of the colors to be your main color and to use that one the most, while you use the other two to make small details.
                </p>
                <p>
                Split complementary colors:<br>
                If you take two complementary colors, take two colors beside one of the complementary colors and take away that complementary color, you get three split complementary colors. These have the same visual contrast as complementary colors, but has less tention.
                </p>
                <p>
                Tetradic colors:<br>
                If you take two complementary colors, take two colors beside both of the complementary colors and take away the original complementary colors, you get four tetradic colors. These create a nice contrast between warm and cool colors. The tetradic color scheme works best if you let one color be dominant.
